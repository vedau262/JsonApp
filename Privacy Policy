                <p>
                    This privacy statement (“Privacy Statement”) applies to the treatment of personally identifiable information submitted by, or otherwise obtained from you in connection with the associated application (“Application”). The Application is provided by POPS Worldwide  and may be provided by  another person/organization, on behalf of a POPS Worldwide (“Application Partner”). By using or otherwise accessing the Application, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Statement.
                </p>

                <h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES POPS KIDS TV COLLECT?</h2>
                <p>
                    We collect the personal information you provide to us. We may receive and store any information you submit to the Application (or otherwise authorize us to obtain – such as, from (for example) your Facebook account). The types of personal information collected may include your full name, email address, gender, telephone number, IP address, geographic location, browser information, username, demographic information, and any other information necessary for us to provide the Application services.
                </p>

                <h2>HOW DOES POPS KIDS TV USE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?</h2>
                <p>
                    POPS KIDS TV uses the information described in this Privacy Statement (i) internally, to analyze, develop and improve its products and services, and (ii) as set forth below in the “Will POPS KIDS TV Share any of the personal information it Receives” section below.
                </p>

                <h2>APPLICATION PARTNER TREATMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h2>
                <p>
                    POPS KIDS TV may provide personal information to the applicable Application Partner. The Application Partner’s use of your personal information is subject to the Application Partner’s separate privacy policy – and not this Privacy Statement. The Application Partner’s privacy policy is also linked to the Partner’s Facebook application.
                </p>

                <h2>WILL POPS KIDS TV SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</h2>
                <p>
                    Personal information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone (with the exception of sharing your information with an applicable Application Partner – see the “Application Partner Treatment” section above). We share your personal information only as described below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Application Partners:</b> We will share your personal information with an applicable Application Partner (see the “Application Partner Treatment” section above).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Agents:</b> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, POPS KIDS TV’s agents do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of personal information for the above purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Business Transfers:</b> In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer’s information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if POPS KIDS TV, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that POPS KIDS TV goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user’s information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of POPS KIDS TV may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Protection of POPS KIDS TV and Others:</b> We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and/or other agreements; and/or protect the rights, property, safety of POPS KIDS TV, our employees, our users, and/or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>With Your Consent:</b> Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
                </p>
