After, the children go out to play in the snow where they build a snowman and name him Frosty. Suddenly, Hinkle's rabbit, Hocus Pocus, hops outside and a gust of wind blows the hat onto Frosty, bringing him to life, delighting the children, but Hinkle, after discovering this as well, takes it back after the wind blows it off Frosty's head. The other children object, but he tells them that when they grow up, they'll learn that snowmen can't come to life and leaves.",
