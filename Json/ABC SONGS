    "description": "Just knowing our ABCs isn't enough, it is important to know how to use these alphabets correctly. For example, we say Apple with an 'Aaa' and not with an 'Ehh' sound don't we? These are what we call as 'phonics', the study of how to speak the alphabet. It may sound boring to you kids, so we decided to make learning phonics much easier and fun for you, through a special phonics song! Watch as your friends, the alphabets, dance on your screen with your kindergarten friends, teaching you how you should speak them correctly. With such a catchy children song in the background, you will definitely stand up and dance with your preschool buddies. But one suggestion; open your mouths as wide as you can so that you can recite the alphabets well, and try naming more objects in your house once the song ends!\nthe phonic song by Kids TV - The nursery rhymes channel for kindergarten aged children.
