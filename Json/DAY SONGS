That's right! \nEach day is something new. \nNow, think about the many things \nthat you may want to do. \n\nSunday is the first day. \nHave fun with the family. \nA drive, the zoo, a picnic—\nor maybe do all three! \n\nMonday is the second day. \nThe week is on its way. \nWhat a good idea it is \nto go outside and play! \n\nSunday! Monday! \nTuesday! Wednesday! Thursday! \nFriday! Saturday! \nThen start again on Sunday. \nA week is seven days! \n\nTuesday is the third day—\na great day for the park. \nSwinging, sliding, climbing things \nuntil the sky gets dark! \nWednesday is the fourth day. \nAnd something that's fun to know—\nit's in the middle of the week \nwith three more days to go! \n\nSunday! Monday! \nTuesday! Wednesday! Thursday! \nFriday! Saturday! \nThen start again on Sunday. \nA week is seven days! \n\nThursday is the fifth day—\na play date with a friend. \nYou have so much fun that you \nnever want this day to end! \n\nFriday is the sixth day. \nOutside, you hear some rain. \nDo a puzzle! Draw a picture! \nRead a story or play a game! \n\nSunday! Monday! \nTuesday! Wednesday! Thursday! \nFriday! Saturday! \nThen start again on Sunday. \nA week is seven days! \n\nSaturday's the seventh day. \nAnd now the week is done. \nSeven days go by so fast \nwhen you are having fun! \n\nSunday! Monday! \nTuesday! Wednesday! Thursday! \nFriday! Saturday! \nThen start again on Sunday. \nA week is seven days! \nSunday! Monday! \nTuesday! Wednesday! Thursday! \nFriday! Saturday! \nThen start again on Sunday. \nA week is seven days! \n\nI said a week is seven days.
