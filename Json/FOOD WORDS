Or do you like junk food?\nDo you like healthy food? Or do you like junk food?\n\nI like chocolate bars! And I like apple pie!\nI like chips and cookies! And I like salty fries!!\n\nBut healthy food makes you strong\nHealthy food makes you fast!\nJunk food it makes you weak,\nJunk food makes you big and fat\n\nI don’t care about that! I’ll have a pizza please!\nAnd ill take some soda! And some extra cheese!\n\nBut healthy food helps you grow, Healthy food is good for you\nJunk food it makes you soft, junk food it makes you slow\n\nBut I like fudge and churros! I like candy too!\nI like hot dogs! I like fast food!\n\nEating all this junk food! Makes me feel alive!\nBut as the time goes by, I feel like I could cry! \n\n…\n\nToo much junk food in you…\nAnd now you cant even, move\nYou know that it’s good for you,\nWhy did you avoid, the healthy food?\n\nWhy’d I eat the junk food!? I want fish and eggs!\nI love nuts and yogurt! I love fruit and veg! \n\nI love cheese and broccoli! I love rice and beans!\nI love ice water! And salad that is green!\n\nAnd sometimes I’ll eat junk food! But I won’t forget!\nOnly eat a little bit and get more healthy food!\n\n*****\n\nMusic and animation written, performed, and made by Adam Williams-Walters.\nCopyright 2016 Adam Williams-Walters/English Tree TV, All rights reserved.",

        "description": "In this video we introduce several sentences along with 24 food cards.  This is the first time we've mixed real video footage with animated footage.  We did this because we wanted to model the chant for viewers, both children and their parents.  What do you think? :)\n\nSentences include:\n1.  I like (apples).\n2.  I want (chicken).\n3.  (Cookies) are delicious.\n4.  (Onions) are stinky.\n5.  DESCRIPTIVE SENTENCES (Light green lettuce.)\n\nClick here to Subscribe:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/omigrad?sub_confirmation=1\nJoin us on\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/elflearning\nG+: https://plus.google.com/+ELFKidsVideos\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ELFLearning\nWebsite: https://www.elflearning.jp\n\n\nThe idea was to provide context and pattern practice for each vocabulary item.  More examples of this can be found here.\n\nAnimals - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzQq2bLs1I\nMy Town - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEfYZ40cqAw ELF Learning creates learning materials for kids all over the world.  Based in Japan, we publish books, CDs, DVDs and of course...learning videos!\n\nOur videos are designed for children ages 2~10 and cover a wide range of topics.  \n\nOur song videos are a mix of original and classic children's songs.  We try hard to add the ELF touch - clear vocals, different genres and lots of cool instruments.  \n\nOur learning videos cover vocabulary, phrases and patterns perfect for the ESL and EFL classroom. \n\nMany of our videos work well with special needs children, especially those with Autistic Disorder, Speech and Language Impairments and Speech, Reading and Learning Disabilities.  We often receive emails from parents thanking us for helping their child learn to speak or read and each time it makes our day!  \n\n(You can learn more about autism at this link: http://www.autismspeaks.org/)\n\nYou can learn more about ELF Learning here:\nAlternate YouTube Page (for teachers and material support): https://www.youtube.com/user/ELFLearning\n\nELF Learning - Everyone Loves FUN Learning!",
