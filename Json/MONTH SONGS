    "description": "Here is our \"Months of the Year Song\" - a fun folk song to help kids learn all 12 months of the year. Mother Hen sings the first verse alone so the kids can become familiar with the melody. During the 2nd verse, the kids sing along with Mother Hen. During the 3rd and 4th verses, both the kids and Mother Hen sing quietly and then loudly. In the final verse, the song speeds up to give the kids a fun challenge.\n\nThis song is perfect for both English speaking children and young learners of ESL/EFL!\n\nBuy this song (mp3):\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/artist/the-singing-walrus/id992755520\nhttps://play.google.com/store/music/artist/The_Singing_Walrus?id=Acadfghn7zw3q5i2c6bfr3gmcnu\n\nBuy this video (mp4):\nhttps://sellfy.com/thesingingwalrus\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporter Mayu Sasaki!\n\nThe Singing Walrus creates fun teaching materials, such as kids songs, educational games, nursery rhymes, and kindergarten worksheets (e.g. handwriting worksheets) for parents and teachers.
