Do you toddler think you’ll can take on the Carrot Finger Family in singing the Finger Family Song? If so, let’s see who sings louder, is more playful and does finger play for longer! We’re no referee in this match, but we can initiate playfulness by pasting the lyrics to the finger rhyme below. Get. Set. Take it away children!",
