        "description": "This is a \"Fruit of the Spirit\" song which I and my family wrote and produced for kids of all ages.  The vocals are me and my 11-year-old daughter Melanie.  If you want the sing-along (instruments-only) version of this song, watch it here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQAsbS1GaGc\n\nThe verses (melody and lyrics) are original, while the chorus melody was adapted from another popular \"Fruit of the Spirit\" song.  We started this project because the lyrics of that other song were inexplicably negative (\"The fruit of the Spirit's *not* a banana\"), and we wanted a positive approach to this wonderful metaphor.\n\nFeel free to download this video for your own usage, with no restrictions.  Make your own video to go with the song, or record your own voices over the karaoke version.  You may also perform and record your own version of this song, and upload to YouTube.
