This cute song can make an English lesson more exciting and engaging for preschoolers and early school kids learning English clothes vocabulary. I hope educators and children from all over the world will enjoy this cute and simple song.\n\nYou can find this clothing song lyrics as well as corresponding worksheets, flashcards, coloring pages and tips on how to make use of the song during your English lessons on my blog at : http://english4kids-step-by-step.blogspot.com/2015/04/clothing-song-for-kids.html\n\nClothes Song Lyrics:\nWho is wearing a scarf?\nCan’t you see? It’s a giraffe.\nWho is wearing a hat?\nIt’s a funny brown bat.\n\nWho is wearing a skirt?\nIt’s a little hummingbird.\nWho is wearing a shirt?\nIt is just a mockingbird.\n\nAre you wearing a dress?\nIf you’re a girl, say: “Yes!”\nAre you wearing corduroys?\nSay: “Yes, we are!” if you are boys.\n\nCredits:\nLyrics: Julia Hetman\nVocal: Hande Burdg (http://www.15hifi.com/hande/ , https://www.fiverr.com/hburdg/session-singer-with-four-octaves)\nMusic: Olga Nesterov\nAnimation: Dmitriy Nesterov",
