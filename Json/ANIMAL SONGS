But you can all agree that after preschool, everyone is bored once they are home as they miss their friends and they do not know what to do. Well, we can help you out over here, you kids remember the Finger Family childrens’ rhyme right? Where you keep calling for each of the fingers to come out? Why don’t you look at your fingers and make some family of your own? It could be anything from animals to shapes to alphabets to even monsters! The only rule is, you must sing the nursery rhyme correctly, as that’s the only way to have the most fun! You babies have huge imaginations, but to help you, we have a list of Finger Families to help you make your own, and to recite the baby rhyme without a mistake!\n\n============================================\nMusic and Lyrics: Copyright USP Studios™\nVideo: Copyright USP Studios™\n============================================",
